# Robot Car Design

## Overview

As part of the **EN2533 Robot Design and Competition** course during semester 3, our team was tasked with designing and building a robot car to complete a given challenge and compete for the win. My role in the team was to create the 3D design of the robot car using SolidWorks. The design was instrumental in the fabrication and assembly of the robot.

## 3D Design Views

Below are the rendered views of the robot car design:

### Top View

The top view highlights the overall layout of components and provides insight into the robot’s structural design.

## Fabrication

The robot’s main chassis was laser-cut based on the 3D model created in SolidWorks. This ensured precise dimensions and alignment for assembly, resulting in a well-structured robot.

## Tools & Resources

The design was created using:

- **SolidWorks:** For 3D modeling and rendering.
- **Laser Cutting:** For fabricating the robot's chassis based on the 3D design.

## Additional Components Assembled to Chassis

### Motor Supports

These supports were designed to securely attach and fit the motor to the chassis.

### Wheels

Simple wheels were designed for the robot car to ensure smooth movement.

### Robot Arm

A robot arm was created to perform the box arrangement task in Task 6. This arm allows the robot to grab and move boxes efficiently.

### L-Shaped Arm with Ultrasonic Sensor

An L-shaped arm was designed with an ultrasonic sensor mounted at the top. This sensor is used to measure the height of the boxes for precise placement.
