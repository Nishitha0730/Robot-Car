# Robot Car Design

## Overview

As part of the **EN2533 Robot Design and Competition** course during semester 3, our team was tasked with designing and building a robot car to complete a given challenge and compete for the win. My role in the team was to create the 3D design of the robot car using SolidWorks. The design was instrumental in the fabrication and assembly of the robot.

## Fabrication

The robot’s main chassis was laser-cut based on the 3D model created in SolidWorks. This ensured precise dimensions and alignment for assembly, resulting in a well-structured robot.

## Tools & Resources

The design was created using:

- **SolidWorks:** For 3D modeling and rendering.
- **Laser Cutting:** For fabricating the robot's chassis based on the 3D design.
